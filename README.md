#Atm System

Brief summary of the project:
The user will insert their debit or ATM card into the machine which will allow for the system to proceed to user verification. The system will ask the user to enter their unique four digit pin code and upon verification the user will enter the system. Once logged in, the user can either deposit, withdraw, or check an account balance.
